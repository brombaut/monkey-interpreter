# Monkey Interpreter & Compiler/Virtual Machine
Result of reading "Writing An Interpreter In Go" and the sequel "Writing A Compiler In Go" by Thorsten Bell.

## Run Interpreter REPL
```
./monkey-interpreter
```

## Run Compiler/Virtual Machine REPL
```
./monkey-compiler
```

## Run REPL Locally
Note that the REPL is configured to use the Compiler and Virtual Machine. Switch to the Interpreter branch to use the REPL with interpreter evaluator.
```
go run main.go
```

## Benchmarks
A benchmarking program was included to test the performance of the interpreter evaluator against the compiler and the virtual machine. The benchmark uses the *fibonacci* number calculator to test the performance.
```JavaScript
let fibonacci = fn(x) {
  if (x == 0) {
    0
  } else {
    if (x == 1) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
    }
  }
};
fibonacci(35);
```

The results from the benchmark program using the interpreter evalutor are below.
```
$./gibonacci -engine=eval
engine=eval, result=9227465, duration=33.979495618s
```

The results from the benchmark program using the compiler & virtual machine are below (~3.3x faster!).
```
$./gibonacci -engine=vm
engine=vm, result=9227465, duration=9.585806116s
```

## Tests
Run tests for all packages
```
go test ./...
```
Run tests for a specific package
```
go test ./ast/
```


## The Monkey Programming Language
Below are some code examples that showcase the language features of Monkey.

### What Monkey looks like.
``` JavaScript
// Bind values to names with let-statements
let version = 1;
let name = "Monkey programming language";
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let coolBooleanLiteral = true;

// Use expressions to produce values
let awesomeValue = (10 / 2) * 5 + 30;
let arrayWithValues = [1 + 1, 2 * 2, 3];
```

### Monkey supports recursive functions, conditionals, implicit and explicit returning of values.
```JavaScript
// Define a `fibonacci` function
let fibonacci = fn(x) {
  if (x == 0) {
    0                /* Monkey supports implicit returning of values */
  } else {
    if (x == 1) {
      return 1;      /* ... and explicit return statements */
    } else {
      fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2); /* Recursion */
    }
  }
};
```

### Monkey supports any combination of the following data types: booleans, strings, hashes, integers and arrays.
```JavaScript
/* Here is an array containing two hashes, that use strings as keys and integers and strings as values */
let people = [{"name": "Anna", "age": 24}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 99}];

/* Getting elements out of the data types is also supported. */
/* Here is how we can access array elements by using index expressions: */
fibonacci(myArray[4]);
// => 5

/* We can also access hash elements with index expressions: */
let getName = fn(person) { person["name"]; };

/* And here we access array elements and call a function with the element as argument: */
getName(people[0]); // => "Anna"
getName(people[1]); // => "Bob"
```

### Functions are first-class citizens, and higher-order functions are supported.
```JavaScript
/* Define the higher-order function `map`, that calls the given function `f` on each element in `arr` and returns an array of the produced values. */
let map = fn(arr, f) {
  let iter = fn(arr, accumulated) {
    if (len(arr) == 0) {
      accumulated
    } else {
      iter(rest(arr), push(accumulated, f(first(arr))));
    }
  };

  iter(arr, []);
};

/* Now let's take the `people` array and the `getName` function from above and use them with `map`. */
map(people, getName); // => ["Anna", "Bob"]
```

### Monkey supports closures.
```JavaScript
/* newGreeter returns a new function, that greets a `name` with the given 'greeting`. */
let newGreeter = fn(greeting) {
  // `puts` is a built-in function we add to the interpreter
  return fn(name) { puts(greeting + " " + name); }
};

// `hello` is a greeter function that says "Hello"
let hello = newGreeter("Hello");

// Calling it outputs the greeting:
hello("dear, future Reader!"); // => Hello dear, future Reader!
```
